The recommended path for most users is to follow ["Automatically upgrade from InfluxDB 1.x to InfluxDB 2.0"]().

If you **do not** have authorization enable in InfluxDB 1.x,
see the [manual upgrade process](/influxdb/v2.0/upgrade/v1-to-v2/manual-upgrade).

<!-- If you will be continuing to use 1.x client libraries to write data to InfluxDB 2.0, -->
